Hello! I'm Jona May Ymas.
I am in my 4th year at De La Salle University - Dasmarinas taking a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
 My hobbies are watching Korean dramas or any TV series. I'm currently watching a Korean series called Moving. My favorite American TV series is Modern family. I also love cooking especially Japanese dishes.
